# LearnCMake

Following the [Professional CMake: A Practical Guide](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/) book, this repository contains training workshops with the aim of learning the CMake tool.

Workshops include custom projects and exercises to practice the concepts learned in the book. The workshops are written in modern CMake following the best practices and idioms.

Each chapter requiring a training from the book will have a corresponding workshop as a CMake project.
